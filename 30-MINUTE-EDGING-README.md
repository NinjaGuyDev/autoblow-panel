# 30-Minute Slow Edging Funscript

## Overview
A 30-minute edging funscript designed with slow, teasing movements and dynamic speed variations.

## File Details
- **Filename**: `30-minute-slow-edging.funscript`
- **Duration**: 30.1 minutes (1,807 seconds)
- **Total Actions**: 3,809 movements
- **Average Speed**: 10 units/second
- **File Size**: 178KB

## Features Implemented

### ✓ Fluid Motions
- **97.3%** of movements are >40ms duration (fluid, not jerky)
- Average segment duration: 473.7ms
- Smooth transitions with wave, gradual, and plateau patterns

### ✓ Asymmetric Speed (Upward Faster)
- **Upward speed**: 28.76 units/second
- **Downward speed**: 22.07 units/second
- **Speed ratio**: 1.30x (upward is 30% faster)
- ✓ Within target range of 25-40% faster

### ✓ Random Pauses
- **189 pauses** distributed throughout
- Average pause duration: 1.0 seconds
- Max pause: 3.0 seconds
- Pauses occur at ~15% frequency

### ✓ Full Stroke Intensifiers
- **5 full strokes** (0↔100) distributed across the session
- Located at: 5.3min, 8.9min, 17.2min, 23.2min, and 27.8min
- Each stroke takes 3.5-5.9 seconds for the extreme transition
- Balanced: 5 visits to position 0, 5 visits to position 100

### ✓ Speed Variations Every 60 Seconds
- Speed increases by 10-30% for 60 seconds
- Returns to baseline for 60 seconds
- Alternates throughout the entire duration
- Creates dynamic intensity cycles

### ✓ Edging-Optimized Position Distribution
- **Primary edging zone (41-80)**: 69.5% of time
- **Lower range (21-40)**: 18.6%
- **Upper range (81-100)**: 8.1%
- **Extreme lows (0-20)**: 3.8%
- Maintains arousal in the "sweet spot" with occasional teasing extremes

## Motion Patterns Used

The script incorporates three main motion types:

1. **Wave Motions** - Smooth sinusoidal movements with natural variation
2. **Gradual Motions** - Steady climbs/descents with easing
3. **Plateau Motions** - Movements with holds at intermediate positions

## Technical Notes

- Uses funscript v1.0 format
- Compatible with all funscript players
- Position range: 0-100
- Timestamps in milliseconds
- Not inverted

## Generation Details

Generated using a custom Python script (`generate_edging_script.py`) with:
- Randomized motion selection for variety
- Physics-based speed calculations
- Strategic full stroke placement
- Pause insertion at natural transition points

## Usage

Load this funscript into your compatible device's player software alongside a 30+ minute video. The slow, teasing pace is designed for extended edging sessions.
